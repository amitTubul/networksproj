# Networks Project

This repository contains the code for the Networks Project, developed as part of the Computer Science and Mathematics program. The project demonstrates [insert project purpose here, e.g., "a simulation of a peer-to-peer network protocol" or "a client-server communication model using sockets"].

## Overview

This project explores [describe primary concepts like socket programming, threading, etc.]. It is designed to help understand the core principles of networking through practical implementation.

## Features

- **Feature 1**: [Explain feature, e.g., "Establishes a server-client model to exchange messages."]
- **Feature 2**: [Explain feature, e.g., "Implements multi-threading to handle multiple clients simultaneously."]
- **Feature 3**: [Explain feature, e.g., "Includes a simple protocol to send structured messages between nodes."]

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amitTubul/networksproj.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd networksproj
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   > Note: If you encounter missing dependencies, you may need to adjust `requirements.txt` to fit your environment.

## Usage

This project includes both server and client components. To run the application, follow these steps:

### 1. Start the Server

In one terminal, navigate to the project directory and run the server:

```bash
python src/server.py
```

The server should start and display a message confirming it's listening on the specified IP and port (adjustable in `config.py`).

### 2. Run a Client

Open a new terminal and navigate to the project directory. To start a client instance, run:

```bash
python src/client.py
```

The client will attempt to connect to the server, and once connected, it will [describe what happens next, e.g., prompt for input, start sending messages, etc.].

### 3. Interact with the Network

With multiple clients connected, you can test network interactions by [explain usage, e.g., "sending messages," "executing commands," etc.]. Each client can [describe interaction capabilities like message exchange, file transfer, etc.].

## Project Structure

Here's an overview of the main files and directories:

- `main.py`: The primary entry point for running the project.
- `config.py`: Contains settings for IP addresses, port numbers, and other configurations.
- `src/`: Directory with core components.
  - `client.py`: The client-side code to connect and interact with the server.
  - `server.py`: The server-side code to manage incoming client connections.
- `tests/`: Contains test scripts to validate functionality.

## Configuration

You can adjust network settings and parameters in `config.py` to match your setup, including IP addresses, ports, and buffer sizes.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run this project:

- `socket`: For network communication.
- `threading`: To handle multiple clients concurrently.
- `json` or `pickle` (optional): For serializing data sent over the network.

These libraries are available in the Python Standard Library, so no external installations should be needed unless further customization is done.

## Contributing
